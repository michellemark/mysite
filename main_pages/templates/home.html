            My name is Michelle Mark and I am a web developer and pythonista with 10+ years experience and a degree in
            computer science.  I have worked in many languages, and I believe languages and frameworks are tools, and
            you should use the right tool for the job.  My favorite tool for web development is Python Django.  I have
            implemented the use of many 3rd party APIs and have created custom APIs from scratch using Django REST
            Framework.  I am very aware of security concerns and have experience in handling HIPAA data.  I love big
            projects and can visualize new software architecture from concept to completion.  Creating understandable
            clean code is my passion.  I am looking to join an established team as a full time remote developer.
