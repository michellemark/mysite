            My name is Michelle Mark and I am a web developer and pythonista with 10+ years experience and a degree in
            computer science.  I have worked in many languages, and I believe languages and frameworks are tools, and
            you should use the right tool for the job.  My favorite tool for web development is Python Django.  I love
            big projects and can visualize new software architecture from concept to completion.  Creating
            understandable clean code is my passion.  I am looking to join an established team as a full time remote
            backend python django developer.  Until I find my forever team, I am booking short term contract
            work.  Should we talk?
